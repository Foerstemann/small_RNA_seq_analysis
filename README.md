# small_RNA_seq_analysis
collection of custom scripts for data analysis generated by the illuina pipeline

This repository contains a series of scripts we generated to process and map small RNA sequencing data. Use at your own risk.
The scripts are hard-coded for a particular computer, not using environment variables. The scripts have to be placed in the home folder of a user called “exchange”, further subfolders apply (please refer to the scripts for the detailed path). We realize that this is an archaic way to proceed, but it ended up like that over the years.

I will gladly respond and help resolve any questions that will likely arise.
